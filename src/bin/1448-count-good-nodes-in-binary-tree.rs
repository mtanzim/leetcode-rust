 * Testcase Example:  '[3,1,4,3,null,1,5]'
 *
 * Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path
 * from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.
 *
 * Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
 * Root Node (3) is always a good node.
 * Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
 * Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
 * Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than
 * it.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Root is considered as good.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
 * Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].
